# TodoList

My project on React.
Simple todo list application.
To do lists don't need to be complicatedâ€”plenty of people use a pen and paper for the job without any problem. And yet a new to do list app seems to come out every day. Why? Because keeping track of your tasks is an intensely personal thing, and people will reject anything that doesn't feel right pretty much instantly.
